Design an Orchestra using object-oriented principles
Please take the following requirements and create an implementation in C#.  Please share the code via a GitHub repository, or other online method.
Here are a few methods that you should be able to run:
•	Tell us how many positions are remaining
•	Tell us how many total positions in the orchestra
•	Tell us when all positions have been filled
•	Tell us when the orchestra has no members
•	Tell us when certain positions are full e.g., violins
•	Tell us how many positions any given type has filled
________________________________________
Assumptions:
•	The orchestra can have violins, cellos and bass
•	A cello can be substituted by 2 violins
•	A bass can be substituted by 4 violins or 2 cellos
